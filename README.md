# Analysis_universities_world
 This dashboard provides an overview of university data, showing key metrics (average, minimum, and maximum scores, and total university count) with filters for country, continent, and league. Visualizations include a continent-wise university count, average score by league, a world map of total scores, and a bar chart of university distribution by continent. Data was extracted from an HTML table, and custom measures were created for analysis.
